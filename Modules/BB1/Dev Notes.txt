This site has a few large customisations.

1. Most of the pages, static content, and home page consist of 'Articles' these are like blog/news articles and have multiple types and features. There are also numerous article list pages e.g. support or reference, these are just lists of articles. The home page is just a list of articles. 

2. Product options. Product options are show as tables so that multiple products can be added at once. The downside of this is that wish/tool lists and quotes and to be customised to cope with multiple additions.

3. Tool lists. Loads of little wishlist alterations. Including, mail me and download CSV.
